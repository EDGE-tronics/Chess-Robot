- Raspberry Pi or Windows PC
- Display
- Keyboard 
- Mouse
- Camera (USB or Raspberry Pi Camera Module)
- Lighting
- Chess board and pieces
- Speaker or Headphones (Optional)

### Software

- [Stockfish](https://stockfishchess.org/)
- [Python Chess](https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [PySimpleGUI](https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Modules list

- [Vision Module](https://github.com/Robotics-Technology/Chess-Robot/VisionModule.py)
- [Chess Logic](https://github.com/Robotics-Technology/Chess-Robot/ChessLogic.py)
- [Arm Control](https://github.com/Robotics-Technology/Chess-Robot/ArmControl.py)
- [Interface](https://github.com/Robotics-Technology/Chess-Robot/Interface.py)

## Getting Started

To start using this project, proceed to the standard *clone* procedure:

```bash
cd <some_directory>
git clone https://github.com/Robotics-Technology/Chess-Robot.git
```

## Install

- On Windows PC

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- On Raspberry Pi

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
pip3 install "picamera[array]"
```

If you have issues with OpenCV on the Raspberry Pi try the following commands:

```
sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev
sudo apt-get install libjasper-dev
sudo apt-get install libqtgui4
sudo apt-get install libqt4-test
sudo apt-get install libhdf5-dev 
sudo apt-get install libhdf5-serial-dev
sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt5
sudo apt-get install stockfish
sudo pip3 install opencv-python==3.4.6.27
sudo pip3 install opencv-contrib-python==3.4.6.27
```

## Run

```
cd <project_directory>
python Interface.py
```

## License

LSS Chess Robot is available under the GNU General Public License v3.0

## Contributing

Anyone is very welcome to contribute. Below is a list of identified improvements.

## To do

- Change  the gripper aperture acording to the chess piecce type
- Allow re-taking pictures in the case of board obstruction

## Limitations

- The chessboard is limited by the reach of the arm and the squares need to be big enough so the arm gripper doesnâ€™t stumble upon adjacent pieces.
- This project was specifically made to be used with LSS smart servo motors using the LSS serial communication protocol so if you want to use it for a different robotic arm you will need to change how the servos are controlled and change the inverse kinematics parameters to match your specific arm.
